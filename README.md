Hex dump in Scriptable

Follow the instructions in the comments - this code is meant to be adapted, and the current file isn't great (as file pickers are non-blocking). Hope you can find a use for it!

Note: on larger files, this is extremely slow. I may make an HTML-Javascript version in the future, though, that would be much faster.

Demo video (with the instructions followed already):
